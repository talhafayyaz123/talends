                    <p><b>93%</b> of the prospective consumer searching for a service or product you are offering won't go beyond the first page of  Google. If your website SEO is not good enough to rank you on the first page of Google, you don't exist for them.SEO can be seen as a combination of efforts on the part of a business to compete favorably in search engine result rankings. The importance of appearing on the first search engine result page (SERP) becomes particularly glaring when you consider the fact that the average web surfer does not typically have a great deal of patience to scroll down to the second page.</p>
